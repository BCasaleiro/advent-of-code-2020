# Advent of Code 2020

This repository contains my solutions to the 2020 Advent of Code.

You can find the problem descriptions [here](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

Since I am only participating for fun, I am not committed to optimizing any of my solutions.
The only goal is to have fun, but if you find any improvements, feel free to open a PR! :hugs:

:santa: Merry Christmas!! :christmas_tree:
